    <h2>Study Tips</h2>
    <p>Don't like the grade you got? Well here are some things you can do to improve:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Take good notes. Don't take pictures of the board, instead write down what's on the board in a notebook or even on your laptop. Research has shown that people remember things better when they write it down.</li>
      <li>Staying organized helps prevent any potential problems that may occur. Make a schedule to help manage your time between doing schoolwork and other commitments.</li>
      <li>Remove any distractions while studying! This means turn off all your devices, whether that is your phone, television, or gaming consoles.</li>
      <li>Don't cram all your studying right before an exam.</li>
      <li>It's also important not to overstudy. Take breaks if you need to, and make sure you are well rested before an exam.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>IF YOU CAN DO ALL OF THIS, YOU DON'T GOT TO WORRY ABOUT A THING. YOU GOT THIS!</strong></p>
